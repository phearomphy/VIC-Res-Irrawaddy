# VIC-Res-Irrawaddy
This data repository holds VIC and VIC-Res model input/output data for the Irrawaddy River Basin. The model can be used to simulate hydrological processes and streamflow routing in the entire basin up to year 2023. The streamflow routing scheme can be run with and without water reservoirs.
