# VIC-Res-Irrawaddy
This data repository holds VIC and VIC-Res model input/output data for the Irrawaddy River Basin. The model can be used to simulate hydrological processes and streamflow routing in the entire basin for the period 2001-2023. The streamflow routing scheme can be run with and without water reservoirs.
